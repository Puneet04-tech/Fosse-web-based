# Web Frontend — Fosse Chemical Equipment Visualizer

This is the React web frontend for the project.

Quick start:

1. cd web
2. npm install
3. REACT_APP_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000 npm start

Notes:

- Upload requires Basic Auth credentials (enter username and password in the form).

- The app expects the backend at the default localhost address; change `REACT_APP_API_URL` to point to a deployed backend.
